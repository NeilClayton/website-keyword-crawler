## Website Keyword Crawler

A program to find keywords in the source code of websites.

Purposes:
* Check what pages of your website are infected with a malicious script by known keywords
* Check whether your website its script contains specific keywords

The program is able to process 3 levels, which means it is capable of getting URLs from the script of the page you are scanning - up to three levels.
Compare it to the function of a spider.

## Usage

Usage when using the Python version is:

`python website_keyword_crawl.py`

Fill in the website in format: `http://domain.tld` or `http://subdomain.domain.tld`.
After that you can fill in the keyword you want to look for and the levels you would like to check.

## Results

This program shows the results of a website in two separate files called: `domain.tld positives.log` and `domain.tld errors.log`.
The positives file contains all webpages of the website where the keyword was found. The errors file contains all errors generated by the script while trying to execute the HTTP request.
